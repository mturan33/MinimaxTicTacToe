TicTacToe Game With Minimax Algorithm With C++

# MinimaxTicTacToe

This project is a Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in C++, where the computer opponent uses the Minimax algorithm to make optimal moves. The game is designed to demonstrate the application of the Minimax algorithm in turn-based games, ensuring the AI makes the best possible move each turn.

## Project Structure

The main components of the project are:
- **Game Board**: Represents the Tic-Tac-Toe board and manages game state.
- **Minimax Algorithm**: Implements the Minimax decision-making process for the computer's moves.
- **User Interface**: Allows the player to interact with the game and displays results.

## Features

- **Human vs AI Mode**: Play against the computer with the AI making optimal moves.
- **Optimal Move Calculation**: Uses the Minimax algorithm to ensure the AI either wins or draws, never losing.
- **Clear Game Display**: A simple interface displays the board and game progress.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++
- IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, Visual Studio)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mturan33/MinimaxTicTacToe.git
   ```
2. Open the project in your preferred C++ IDE.
3. Build the project to resolve dependencies.

### Running the Game

1. Run the `Game` class to start the game.
2. Follow on-screen prompts to make your moves.

## How It Works

The Minimax algorithm evaluates each potential move by simulating future moves and choosing the best outcome. It recursively maximizes the AI's potential for winning while minimizing the playerâ€™s chance of winning.
